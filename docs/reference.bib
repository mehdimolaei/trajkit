	abstract = {We demonstrate a novel method for measuring the microrheology of soft viscoelastic media, based on cross correlating the thermal motion of pairs of embedded tracer particles. The method does not depend on the exact nature of the coupling between the tracers and the medium, and yields accurate rheological data for highly inhomogeneous materials. We demonstrate the accuracy of this method with a guar solution, for which other microscopic methods fail due to the polymer's mesoscopic inhomogeneity. Measurements in an F-actin solution suggest conventional microrheology measurements may not reflect the true bulk behavior.},

	abstract = {Motile bacteria play essential roles in biology that rely on their dynamic behaviours, including their ability to navigate, interact and self-organize. However, bacteria dynamics on fluid interfaces are not well understood. Swimmers adsorbed on fluid interfaces remain highly motile, and fluid interfaces are highly non-ideal domains that alter swimming behaviour. To understand these effects, we study flow fields generated by
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              PA01 in the pusher mode. Analysis of correlated displacements of tracers and bacteria reveals dipolar flow fields with unexpected asymmetries that differ significantly from their counterparts in bulk fluids. We decompose the flow field into fundamental hydrodynamic modes for swimmers in incompressible fluid interfaces. We find an expected force-doublet mode corresponding to propulsion and drag at the interface plane, and a second dipolar mode, associated with forces exerted by the flagellum on the cell body in the aqueous phase that are countered by Marangoni stresses in the interface. The balance of these modes depends on the bacteria's trapped interfacial configurations. Understanding these flows is broadly important in nature and in the design of biomimetic swimmers.},

	abstract = {From flocks of birds to biomolecular assemblies, systems in which many individual components independently consume energy to perform mechanical work exhibit a wide array of striking behaviors. Methods to quantify the dynamics of these so-called active systems generally aim to extract important length or time scales from experimental fields. Because such methods focus on extracting scalar values, they do not wring maximal information from experimental data. We introduce a method to overcome these limitations. We extend the framework of correlation functions by taking into account the internal headings of displacement fields. The functions we construct represent the material response to specific types of active perturbation within the system. Utilizing these response functions we query the material response of disparate active systems composed of actin filaments and myosin motors, from model fluids to living cells. We show we can extract critical length scales from the turbulent flows of an active nematic, anticipate contractility in an active gel, distinguish viscous from viscoelastic dissipation, and even differentiate modes of contractility in living cells. These examples underscore the vast utility of this method which measures response functions from experimental observations of complex active systems.},
