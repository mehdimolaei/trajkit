# Acknowledgments

This repo is a part of the collection of statistical and ML tools I’ve written over the years for analyzing equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. It’s very much a continuation of what I learned during my graduate and post-graduate work.

A lot of what’s here is influenced by the people who taught me how to think clearly about experiments, data, and uncertainty. I’m especially grateful to my mentors **Jian Sheng**, **Margaret Gardel**, **John Crocker**, and **Kate Stebe**. I’ve also learned a ton from conference talks, hallway conversations, and generous discussions with peers—many of the best ideas come from those moments.

More recently, I wanted to learn a few new Python libraries and try some newer methods on top of my earlier work, so this repository also became my “learning project” for building a cleaner, more reusable toolkit. I have a few CDV-related projects in mind and I’ll share them over time as they become ready.

If you notice something that should be credited more clearly, or you want to contrinute to this project of mine or you have suggestions for improving the code or docs, I’d genuinely appreciate an issue or PR.
